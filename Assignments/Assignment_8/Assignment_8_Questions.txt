1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.

Yes, as temperature decreases the growth rate prediction increases. This is because only two different temperatures were used in the study and given that 20 degrees grows faster than 25, the model thinks it will always increase as temperature decreases. This is obviously not true, as even though I'm no botanist I can tell you these species will not have higher growth rates at -10 degrees celsius.

2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.

It looks like as light increases its an exponential increase for growth rate predictions.

3. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

 ggplot(aes(x=(predictor^3),y=(response))) +  geom_point() +  geom_smooth()

Simply using an exponential or logarithmic function in the plotting equation can allow for a linear plot between the value and response.
