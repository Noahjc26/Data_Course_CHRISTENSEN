2. Using ASTER/AVIRIS satellite data to determine rock lithology in areas of receding glaciers or inaccessible outcrops. 

3. The data will consists of absorption features for different wavelengths and using Band math to create visualizations of the imagery and/or viewing the wavelength absorption signature. I am planning on working with Matt Olson (he recommended I take this class since I wanted to learn R for GIS related work) and potentially using hyper-spectral sensors on field samples which would give much more information than the satellite data on mineral absorption.

I will get the ASTER data from UGS Earth Explorer.   
I found hyper spectral data online just to testing r and plot.
I also mapped the NDSI on a Landsat Image to test it out
